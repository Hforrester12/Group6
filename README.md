### Company Background

### How Kiva Uses Tech to their Advantage

### Kiva's Strengths and Weaknesses

---
Strenths: Kiva uses the internet to administer loans directly, as opposed to utilizing local organizations which would incur fees and high interest rates. This results in fewer "debt traps" where these local businesses in impovershed areas will be able to pay back the loan without worrying about interest payments adding to their principal loans.

Weaknesses: As of now, it takes some time to verify identity oversees, however, they are looking to introduce facial recognition and big data to overcome this roadblock.
### Kiva's Future

With other organizations, both big and small, evolving into this space, the industry is creating new ways to execute these microloans more efficiently and securely. Kiva will move into other FinTech domains such as blockchain, big data, and AI to speed up loan approvals and provide a cheaper method of microloaning.
